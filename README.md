midas-founder-age
=================

Looking at the average age and average spread of founders who've received investments from Midas List VCs
 wanted to find average founder age by VC investor -- do VCs exhibit particular age preferences? I took the twenty VCs from this year's Midas List and the founders of their past three investments. To get the founder ages, I used Abe's data when available (thanks, Abe!), year of graduation as per Linkedin, and good ole fashioned googling when the first two options didn't pan out. Big caveat lector being that the graduation year-based estimate is only that -- an estimate. I did try to use high school or bachelors' graduation years, instead of grad school, as the latter is more varied.
